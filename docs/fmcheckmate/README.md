# fmCheckMate Documentation

Here you can learn about fmWorkMateÂ´s fmCheckmate Tool.

## What is fmCheckMate?

fmCheckMate is the core tool of the fmWorkMate toolbox.

You can

- **convert** FileMaker objects on the **clipbard to/from FileMaker** (fmxmlsnippet) XML
  - which alone is *great* for transfering code to/from a remote computer!
- search & replace the XML 
  - **rename variables**
  - **move code to a different layout context**
- view / edit the XML.
  - in the built-in XML-editor, or
  - in an external editor
- and - with the fmCheckMate-XSLT Library - you can perform hundreds of (quite frankly amazing) functions to analyse, change and transform your XML. (See below)

## Setting up fmCheckMate

In the fmCheckMate settings 

- fmCheckMate mode
  - 
- Editor
  - Size & window positioning
  - 
- XML
  - search highlighting
  - syntax highlighting
  - formatting
- Functions
  - 
- File
  - interaction with an external file & editor
  - saving of iDDR ('instant DDR') files


Open the Settings (CMD+9) to choose the mode.

Another CMD+9 takes you to the detailed settings.

There you can

- turn tips on/off
- define window size / behaviour
- etc.


### **Four** Modes of Operation

fmCheckMate has four different modes of operation

1. **Convert/Transfer** Mode
   - which just converts the clipboard, but does not display the XML
2. **Internal Editor** Mode
   - for quick editing & transforming of your XML
   - Choose between small or large editor
3. **External Editor** Mode
   - for power-editing in your preferred editor
4. **Analysis** mode
   - for quickly selecting appropriate analysis functions (for example for focussed Layout Analysis)

The default mode is 'Small Internal Editor' which displays the XML in a small window after conversion.
