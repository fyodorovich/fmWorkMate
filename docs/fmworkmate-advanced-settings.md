# Settings for wannabe tool developers

This section is for developers wishing to extend fmWorkMate with new tools ... and is still under construction.

### (i) > [Tool Settings]

From the fmWorkmate Settings page you can open the Tools Settings page, which is only of interest if you are considering developing/integrating further tools into the fmWorkmate toolbox.

Here you can define the list of tools, their behaviour when you click on a tool, tool names straplines and icons.

New tools must be added here ... and integrated into the tool opening script - but that's a topic for another day! ;-)
