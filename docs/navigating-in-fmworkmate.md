# Navigating in fmWorkmate

Most of MrWatson´s apps follow the same navigation and user interaction paradigm.

## Standardised Navigation, Menus and Keyboard shortcuts

MrWatson´s apps have a standardised menu structure and keyboard shortcuts:

| FileMaker Pro | \<Tool> Menu          | ... | Window                | Help |
| ------------- | --------------------- | --- | --------------------- | ---- |
| About \<Tool> | ⌘1 Home/Back          |     |  ⌘0 Maximize/Reset    |      |
|               |  ⌘2 Tool function     |     | ⌘⇧W Hide Window       |      |
|               |   :                   |     |  ⌘W Close Window      |      |
|               |  ⌘8 Tool function     |     | ⌘⌥W Close All Windows |      |
|               |  ⌘9 Settings          |     |                       |      |

The Tool Menu is comparable with the scripts menu and ⌘2 through ⌘9 are similarly the main tool shortcut keys

- ⌘1 is almost invariably Home/Back
- ⌘9 is typically used to open the Settings
- ⌘0 is used to Maximize or Reset the window
- Variants of ⌘W are used to Close and hide or close all windows.

## Navigation from fmWorkmate with the keyboard

Many jobs in fmWorkMate are repetitive, and it is thus essential to be able to navigate between tools quickly and efficiently.

The keys to open tools and the key to perform their main function have thus been carefully coordinated for maximum navigation speed and productivity:

| From fmWorkMate…   | Key Combo | does this                      |
|--------------------|-----------|------------------------------- |
| fmCheckMate        |  ⌘2 +  ⌘2 | Opens + Converts the Clipboard |
| fmLogAnalyser      |  ⌘3 +  ⌘3 | Opens + Reloads the log file   |
| fmDBAnalyser       |  ⌘4       | Opens fmDBAnalyser             |
| fmSyntaxColorizer  |  ⌘5 +  ⌘5 | Opens + Colorizes your scripts |
|                    |     +     |                                |
| fmTextConverter    |  ⌘6 +  ⌘8 | Opens + Converts again         |
| fmTextDiff         |  ⌘7 +  ⌘7 | Opens + Diffs Text again       |
| fmTextMultiplier   |  ⌘8 +  ⌘8 | Opens + Multiplies again       |
| fmTextSeries       | ⌘⇧: +     | Opens fmTextSeries             |
| ...                |     +     |                                |

## Remember that key!

 Keyboard shortcuts as well as the tool order have been carefully chosen to help make it easy to memorise the keyboard shortcuts:

| Tool               | Key | Mnemonic / Eselbrücke / donkey bridge                       |
|--------------------|-----|---------------------------------------------------------- |
| fmTextConverter    |  ⌘6 | No mnemonic here, 6 was just the last remaining space! ;-)|
| fmTextDiff         |  ⌘7 | On a US/UK keyboard SHIFT-7 is a DIVIDE (/) symbol        |
| fmTextMultiplier   |  ⌘8 | On a German keyboard SHIFT-8 is a MULTIPLY (*) symbol     |
| fmTextSeries       | ⌘⇧: | Dots of the colon = dots in the from..to series   |
| fmAutomMate        |  ⌘A | A for Automate  |
| fmPasteMate        |  ⌘P | P for PasteMate |
| myMateJSON         |  ⌘J | J for JSON      |
| fmSimpleCalculator | ⌘⇧= | = for Calculate |
