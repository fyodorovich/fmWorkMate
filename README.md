# fmWorkMate
[Makes FileMaker Work]

fmWorkMate is a power toolkit for FileMaker Developers

...from MrWatson of www.mrwatson.de and fmworkmate.com

...and it's been in development since 2008 (as a hobby alongside my 24*7 FileMaker work),

...and it's been used everyday be myself, colleagues, and increasingly more FileMaker developers

...so let's call it Version 1.0, shall we?

 ðŸ¥³ ðŸŽ‰ ðŸ¥‚

## Congratulations!
You now have the FREE OPEN-SOURCE version of fmWorkMate!

LOTS has changed since the last release!

- fmWorkMate is now OPEN SOURCE :-D
  - Not only open source, but [MIT LICENCE][LICENCE]
  - and avaliable on [GitHub][fmWorkMate repo]
- fmWorkMate is now simply FileMaker files.
  - and the runtime version is no more :-/
  - and (thus) you need to
    - bring your own MBS licence,
    - and download and install the [MBS-Plugin][MBS-Plugin] + [Base-Elements-Plugin][Base-Elements-Plugin] yourself.
      - *but you've probably got hose already :-)*
- There are *loads* of new functions!
  - I don't know where to start telling!
  - Take a peek in [fmWorkMate-Changes.txt](fmWorkMate-Changes.txt)

It's a new era! ... Please help make fmWorkMate better and contribute to a power tool for all FileMaker developers everywhere!

Happy FileMaking!

## GETTING STARTED with fmWorkMate

![fmWorkMate logo][fmWorkMate logo w100]

fmWorkMate

1. Download fmWorkMate from [GitHub][fmWorkMate repo]
2. Move the fmWorkMate folder into the Applications folder (recommended, but anywhere will do)

3. Decide which FileMaker you wish to use to open the fmWorkMate files.
   
   TLDR: Just open fmWorkMate.fmp12 and get on with it
   
   You can 
   - either **open fmWorkMate with the same FileMaker** that you open your databases with
     - this requires you to hop between windows (which can be a **bit of a chore**, but might lead to some great integration possibilities later on)
     - just add fmWorkMate to your FleMaker favourites and you are good to go
   - or **open fmWorkMate with a second FileMaker** instance/version
     - this keeps fmWorkMate seperate from your databases, making it **easier to work with**
     - **On Windows** you can open fmWorkMate in a second FileMaker **only with a different version of FileMaker** on your system
     - **On Mac** there is a more elegant solution:
       1. Create a **seperate FM-app**
          - Duplicate your FileMaker Pro app, and rename it to 'fmWorkMate.app'
          - Place it in the fmWorkMate Folder alongside the fmWorkMate files
          - For added comfort, you can also replace the app's icon using the icon in the Finder
            - See [How to change Mac app icons](https://9to5mac.com/2019/01/17/change-mac-icons/)
          - You *could* stop here, and just open the fmWorkMate app and click the  fmWorkMate favourite...
            - ...but we can do better than that...
       2. Use **fmLaunchpad** (with fm19 - or fm18)
      
         ![fmLaunchPad logo][fmLaunchPad logo w100]

         [fmLaunchPad][fmLaunchpad home] is a cool little starter file ðŸš€ rocket you can 'programme' to open the file you really want to open.

         You'll be setup in just 3 or 4 steps:
        - [Download fmLaunchPad from GitHub][fmLaunchPad repo] and place it next to fmWorkMate
          - or, alternatively, place the fmLaunchPad *folder* next to the fmWorkMate *folder* in your Applications folder
        - Setup the FileMaker starter file -> fmLaunchPad
          - In fm19+
            - Open your fmWorkMate.app
            - In Preferences set the starter file to start fmLaunchPad
            - Close it again
            - Note: the starter file is valid for all fm18 and higher!
          - In fm18 (if you have no fm19)
            - While originally you could only set the starter file during installation of the FileMaker Client, it is also possible to set the preference from the command line. 
            - See ["Setting FileMakerâ€™s startup file from CLI" from Beezwax](https://blog.beezwax.net/2020/06/09/setting-filemaker-startup-file-from-cli/)
        - Open your fmWorkMate App again
          - We have lift off! ðŸš€
             
            With a bit of luck fmLaunchPad should open and automatically launch the fmWorkMate file :D

            If not, fmLaunchPad might need tweaking (and in these very early days of release 1.0 it is quite likely):
        - Tweak/Setup fmLaunchPad
          
           Since the FileMaker startup file setting is a global setting which applies to all FileMaker version >= 18, you will also have to set up the starting conditions for your OTHER FileMaker files

          - Start fmLaunchPad again
          - Press the Abort button to stop the mission
          - Switch view (button top right) to see all the rocket's modules
          - Remove, reorder or setup the rocket's modules as necessary
            - Each module represents a different starter-mission
              - Left is the mission's start condition
              - Middle is the destination file you want to reach
              - Right are mission settings (try out capsule)
            - See the documentation in [fmLaunchPad][fmLaunchpad home] for details how to do that!

4. You're good to go - have fun! :)

## GETTING STARTED with fmCheckMate

![fmCheckMate logo][fmCheckMate logo w100]

fmCheckMate is the core tool of the toolbox.

You can

- **convert** FileMaker objects on the **clipbard to/from FileMaker** (fmxmlsnippet) XML
  - which alone is *great* for transfering code to/from a remote computer!
- search & replace the XML 
  - **rename variables**
  - **move code to a different layout context**
- view / edit the XML.
  - in the built-in XML-editor, or
  - in an external editor
- and - with the fmCheckMate-XSLT Library - you can perform hundreds of (quite frankly amazing) functions to analyse, change and transform your XML. (See below)

### fmCheckMate Modes

fmCheckMate has some different modes of operation

- Convert/Transfer
  - which just converts the clipboard, but does not display the XML
- Internal Editor (small or large)
  - for quick editing & transforming of your XML
- External Editor
  - for power-editing in your preferred editor
- Analysis mode
  - for quickly selecting appropriate analysis functions with 


### fmCheckMate Setings

Open the Settings (CMD+9) to choose the mode.

Another CMD+9 takes you to the detailed settings.

There you can

- turn tips on/off
- define window size / behaviour
- etc.

## GETTING STARTED with the fmCheckMate-XSLT Library

![fmCheckMate-XSLT logo][fmCheckMate-XSLT logo w100]

1. Install the fmCheckMate XSLT Librabry
   - Download the fmCheckMate XSLT Librabry from [GitHub][fmCheckMate XSLT repo]
   - Move the fmCheckMate folder into your Documents folder
2. Load the fmCheckMate XSLT Librabry into fmCheckMate
   - The first time you open the XSLT Chooser (by pressing the [T] button in the internal editor / CMD+T(ransform)) the fmCheckMate XSLT Library should be loaded into fmCheckMate
   - If not, use the reload button (or CMD+8)
3. Transform your Code
   - Copy some FileMaker objects (CMD+C)
   - Start fmWorkMate and choose fmCheckMate (CMD+2)
   - Convert the Clipboard (Big button or CMD+ALT+C(onvert) or CMD+2)
   - In the XSML-editor layout press the [T] button (or press CMD+T(ransform))
   - Choose a function
     - Change view & Browse the functions, or
     - Search by name
     - Filter by type
    - Press Return to Apply

## KNOWN ISSUES


- Not everything is tested (but core stuff is *used* every day).

- You can break things. Test before you try.

- FileMaker itself does not copy & paste all objects 100% correctly (notably the Import Records script step and the calculation context table in field definitions)

- Pasting entire tables, scripts and custom functions creates new objects with new internal IDs. So you may want to just copy the *contents* of an object
